Issues on 17-Jun-2017
-----------------------
1) View items table alignment disturbed with big names.
2) Check all tables alignment with big names.
3) column name "ITEMPRICEDETAILS_ID" in class SoldItem.java
4) with customer bills also loading.
5) if we copy paste then autocomplete not selecting so ui validation fails in script for duplicates.
